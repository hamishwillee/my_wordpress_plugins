This is a library of plugins that I have created or modified for various jobs (for example on ardupilot.com)

* **/instructions_menu_debug/** (Instructions Menu Debug Lists) 
  * A plugin for managing the content of a menu based on available content.
  * This plugin:
    * Lists all wiki pages that are not included in the menu named "Instructions"
    * Lists menu items that are duplicats
    * Lists items in trash that are in the menu.
